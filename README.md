## Background & Overview

ExP is a demo B2B website that provides a customer service management platform where users can create tasks by either recording a conversation or submitting transcripts. When an employee submits a task, text data is sent to the backend. It will then be passed to IBM Watson's Natural Language Understanding API while requesting for certain features such as 'sentiment' or 'keywords'. 

The analysis results will be displayed when the user goes back to the main page. All the data will be displayed in descending order. Managers, executives, and HR representatives will be able to view cumulative data of their team, an employee's tasks and assess each employeeâ€™s performance and customer satisfaction. Employees can view their own data as well.

## Possible Future Implementations
+ Implement feature that allows managers to filter team data based on year, month, week, or day.
